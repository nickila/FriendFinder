# FriendFinder
## Find a friend using this compatibility survey

This app allows a user to enter in their name, an online image of themselves and answer 10 survey questions from 1-5. The app then calculates the scores against a database of previous users and gives back a user with scores most closely matching their own.

Friend Finder uses Node.js, Javascript, jQuery, Express, HTML and Bootstrap and deployed on Heroku. It was made by Brian Nickila following close instructions for the University of Minnesota BootCamp course.
